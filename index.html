<h1>Budgetary Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>Budgetary is a simple, offline budgeting app developed by Michael Murphy. We take your privacy seriously.</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
<p>We do not collect any personal information from you. Budgetary stores all data (budgets, transactions, and notes) locally on your device using SwiftData. No data is sent to our servers or any third-party services.</p>

<h2>2. No Accounts or Tracking</h2>
<p>Budgetary does not require you to create an account, log in, or provide any personal details. There is no analytics, advertising, or tracking technology in the app.</p>

<h2>3. In-App Purchase</h2>
<p>Budgetary is a paid app sold through the Apple App Store. Apple handles all payment processing and collects only the information necessary for the purchase (handled under Apple’s privacy policy).</p>

<h2>4. Data Storage & Security</h2>
<p>All your budgeting data remains on your device. If you enable iCloud sync (optional), your data is encrypted and stored in your personal iCloud account, subject to Apple’s iCloud terms.</p>

<h2>5. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this policy from time to time. The latest version will always be available here.</p>
